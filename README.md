This is the Java Project I have created for this code test.

For running and testing this project, please clone or download this project into your local machine.

Once you downloaded the project just run the Application.java file in the src folder. And no extra parameter require for running the project. The input.csv file should be within the same folder with the Application.java file, which means the paths for input.csv and Application.java should be the same. Once the program has been runned successfully, the output.csv will be created and put into the same folder with input.csv.

Besides, some basic unit test cases has also been added into the Application.java file. These test cases help me to check my work during my working progress. I start to do this project at 12pm in 6/8/2021 and I finished this test at 3pm in 6/8/2021.
